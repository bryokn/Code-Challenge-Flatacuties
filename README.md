# Flatacuties
 
 
 This is an app for voting for the cutest animal! I have
 used a local API and built out the front end for our app, Flatacuties.





As a user, I can:

1. See all character's names in a `div` with the id of `"character-bar"`. Create
   a `span` tag with the character's name and add it to the `div#character-bar`
   once you have retrieved the character data from the server.

2. When the character in the `div#character-bar` is clicked, display the
   character's details in the `div#detailed-info`.

3. When the `form#votes-form` is submitted, add the number of votes from
   the input field to the character displayed in the `div#detailed-info`. **No
   persistence is needed**.

## Project Setup
Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:
Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:
## Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:
* See a list of all animal names. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the character data
GET /characters
# Example Response:

{

 

     "id": 1,

 

     "name": "Mr. Cute",

 

     "image": "https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EquatorialIckyCat-max-1mb.gif",

}
** When viewing an animal’s details, I should be able to add the number of votes for each animal. This number of votes should then be displayed together with the animal’s details. No persistence is needed for the votes.
